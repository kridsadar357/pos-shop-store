# POS Suite — Remaining Tasks / Roadmap

Goals **not yet built**, grouped by area. Items already shipped (POS checkout,
products, suppliers, members, promotions, stock ledger, stock count, receiving,
purchase orders, returns/refunds, reports + dashboard, exports, settings tabs,
setup wizard, licensing + 14-day demo, customer-display PWA, ESC/POS network
printing, notifications, global search) are **not** listed here.

Legend: ⬜ not started · 🟨 partial (notes)

---

## 0. Cross-cutting / CRM
- ✅ Supplier purchase history — `GET /api/suppliers/:id/history` returns committed POs +
  stats (count, total ordered, paid, outstanding, last order); "ประวัติ" modal on the
  Suppliers page (KPI tiles + PO table). Mirrors the member purchase history.

## 1. Multi-branch & warehousing
- ✅ **Phase 1** — `Branch` model + management page, branch switcher, sales &
  shifts attributed to a branch, branch filter on the Sales list
- ✅ **Phase 2 — per-branch stock balances** — `BranchStock` (product × branch),
  branch-aware ledger via `postMovement` (Product.stockQty kept as the all-branch
  total), sales decrement the selling branch
- ✅ **Stock transfer between branches** — `StockTransfer` + page; moves
  BranchStock between branches (total preserved), with source-availability guard
- ✅ Branch selection on **receiving, PO receive, and adjust** (destination branch
  picker; defaults to the active branch)
- ✅ POS reads **branch** stock for availability — products, out-of-stock KPIs and
  badges are scoped to the terminal's active branch (branch selector in the header)
- ✅ Branch filter on **Dashboard, Movements, Shifts, Sales, and the Reports page**
  (all report types); the no-branch view is the consolidated all-branch report
- ✅ Branch-scoped **stock count** — counts snapshot & reconcile the chosen branch's
  on-hand and post COUNT movements to that branch
- ✅ Per-branch settings — PromptPay, printer (type/address/paper) and receipt
  header/footer overrides per branch (empty = inherit global); resolved in
  checkout QR, network printing and the POS receipt

**Multi-branch (§1) is complete.** Possible future polish: per-branch logo, and
branch-scoped POS reprint header/footer in the back office (Sales reprint footer QR
is already branch-correct).

## 2. Hardware & printing
- 🟨 ESC/POS **USB** printing — only network (port 9100) is implemented; USB needs a local print agent/bridge
- ✅ Cash-drawer kick (ESC/POS drawer pulse) — `buildReceipt` pulses the drawer on a
  cash receipt when `Setting.openDrawerOnCash`; plus a manual `/api/print/drawer` endpoint
  + "ทดสอบเปิดลิ้นชัก" button in the Printer settings
- ✅ Configurable Thai code page in the UI — `Setting.escposCodepage` (default 21),
  editable in the Printer settings; `Builder.init(codepage)` uses it (env is just the default)
- ✅ Barcode / shelf-label printing — `Labels` page: pick products (search/category),
  set copies + labels-per-row + retail/wholesale price, print an A4 grid of labels with
  a CODE128 barcode (jsbarcode) of each product's barcode/SKU, name, and price
- ⬜ Customer pole display (VFD) support

## 3. Inventory depth
- ✅ Bulk product import (CSV/Excel) — `POST /api/products/import` upserts by SKU,
  resolves/creates categories by name (catalog only — stock stays in the ledger);
  Products page "นำเข้า" button parses the file with `xlsx` (lazy) and reports
  created/updated/errors. Complements the existing CSV/Excel/ZIP export
- ✅ Reorder suggestions / **auto-PO generation** from low-stock (branch-aware;
  suggested qty + last cost + preferred supplier; one-click creates POs grouped
  by supplier) — on the Purchase Orders page
- ✅ Per-supplier product **cost history** (from goods receipts; shown in the
  product editor) — feeds the reorder suggestions
- ✅ Editable **supplier price lists** — `SupplierProduct` catalogue (per-product
  supplier↔cost with a preferred flag), managed in the product editor; reorder
  suggestions prefer the price list (preferred → cheapest) over last-receipt cost
- ✅ Units-of-measure conversion (buy by box, sell by piece) — Product has a
  purchase unit + pack size; **receiving and PO line entry** both convert
  pack→base (stock & ledger stay in base units)
- ⬜ Batch / lot & expiry-date tracking — **large**: needs batch-level balances
  layered on the per-branch stock model + FEFO picking
- ⬜ Serial-number tracking — **large**: per-unit records + scan-in/scan-out

## 4. Sales & customer features
- ✅ Member purchase history + lifetime value — `GET /api/members/:id/sales` returns the
  member's bills + stats (orders, total spent, avg, last visit); "ประวัติ" modal on the
  Members page shows the history table + KPI tiles (CRM)
- ✅ Loyalty points: accrual + redemption — `Member.points` + `PointTransaction`
  ledger via a single `postPoints()` chokepoint; earn on the net total and redeem
  points as a bill discount at the POS (capped by balance + bill room); voids
  reverse both sides; Settings config (earn baht / redeem value); Members page shows
  balance + history + manual adjust; receipt prints earned/redeemed points
- ✅ Quotations / proforma → convert to sale — `Quotation` + `QuotationItem`
  (snapshotted line prices, retail/wholesale, tax-aware totals). Back-office page:
  CRUD, status workflow (draft→sent→accepted/expired/cancelled), printable A4
  document, export. One-click **convert** creates a completed sale server-side from
  the quoted prices (default เงินเชื่อ/CREDIT), decrements stock, marks CONVERTED
- ✅ Layaway / deposits / partial payment — `Layaway` + `LayawayItem` +
  `LayawayPayment`; create with an opening deposit, record installments (capped at
  the balance), then **complete** (only when fully paid) builds a sale from the
  snapshotted lines, tenders = the collected payments by method, and decrements stock.
  Back-office Layaway page (create + detail with installments/complete/cancel)
- ✅ Split / multi-tender payments on one bill — `SalePayment` model (per-method
  applied amount, summing to the total) is the source of truth; checkout accepts a
  `payments[]` array (cash may overpay → change, non-cash must fit the bill). POS
  split modal, receipt tender breakdown, and split-aware `shiftTotals` + reports
  (payment-methods, cashier). Backfilled existing sales 1 tender each
- ✅ Promotion **scheduling UI** — `startsAt`/`endsAt` editable in the Promotions
  form (datetime-local), with scheduled/active/expired status chips + date range in
  the list; the POS already enforces the window via `activePromotions()`
- ✅ Gift cards / store credit — `GiftCard` + `GiftCardTxn` ledger (via a single
  `postGift()` chokepoint); admin page to issue / reload / enable-disable / view
  history. New `GIFT` PaymentMethod: redeemed at POS as a tender in the split-payment
  modal (code + amount, validated & deducted server-side); voids refund the card.
  Split-aware everywhere (byMethod, reports, receipt). Also a **refund option**: a return
  with refund method GIFT issues a new store-credit card (`RC-xxxxxx`) loaded with the refund
- ⬜ Email / SMS / LINE receipt delivery

## 5. Finance & accounting
- ✅ Petty cash / cash in-out during a shift — `CashMovement` model + POS drawer
  modal (pay-in / pay-out with reason); expected drawer cash and the close-shift
  reconciliation now account for `float + cash sales + pay-ins − pay-outs`
- ✅ Accounts payable: payments against POs — `SupplierPayment` model +
  `/api/payables` (committed POs with total / paid / outstanding, supplier & status
  filters, summary totals; record-payment capped at the outstanding balance).
  Back-office Payables page with KPIs, payment modal + history, and export
- ✅ Full tax invoice (ใบกำกับภาษีเต็มรูป) — `TaxInvoice` (1:1 with a sale) capturing
  buyer legal name / tax ID / address / branch + an official sequential number; issued
  from the Sales bill detail (idempotent, PAID-only), prints a full A4 VAT invoice with
  base / VAT / total derived from the inclusive total
- ✅ Expense tracking & categories — `Expense` model + `/api/expenses` (date-range /
  branch / category filters); back-office Expenses page (ListToolbar + filters +
  Excel/PDF/CSV export, total + by-category summary, CRUD modal). Branch-aware,
  records the user; seeded with a few demo expenses
- 🟨 Multi-currency support — configurable **secondary-currency display** (approx.
  conversion at a set rate) shown on the POS net total and the receipt
  (`Setting.secondaryCurrency`/`secondaryRate`, `secondaryAmount()` helper). Display-only;
  transactions are still recorded in THB. Full multi-currency accounting still pending.

## 6. Reporting & data
- ✅ Cash-flow report — `/reports/cash-flow` (range + branch): cash in (cash sales + petty-cash
  pay-ins) vs cash out (pay-outs + cash expenses + cash refunds) → net. New "กระแสเงินสด" tab
  (statement + KPIs + CSV). Synthesizes sales, petty cash, expenses, and returns
- ✅ Tax-invoice register (รายงานภาษีขาย, สำหรับ ภ.พ.30) — `GET /api/tax-invoices` lists
  issued full tax invoices over a date range with per-invoice VAT base/amount; back-office
  register page (month-default range, period totals base/VAT/total, export)
- ✅ Profit & Loss report — `/reports/profit-loss` (date-range + branch): revenue → less
  VAT → net revenue → less COGS → gross profit → less operating expenses (from the Expense
  table, by category) → net profit, with margins. New "กำไร-ขาดทุน (P&L)" tab on the Reports
  page (statement view + KPIs + CSV export). Ties sales and expenses into the bottom line
- ⬜ Scheduled / emailed reports
- ✅ Z-report / X-report end-of-day printout — printable `ShiftReport` (80mm, same
  print path as the receipt): X = mid-shift snapshot from the POS *More* menu, Z =
  end-of-day close report (offered after closing + reprintable per shift on the
  back-office Shifts page). Shows orders, per-payment-method breakdown
  (`shiftTotals.byMethod`), pay-in/out, and the cash-drawer reconciliation
- ✅ Data backup & restore — generic export/restore driven by Prisma DMMF
  (topological FK order, no per-model maintenance). `/api/backup/export` downloads a
  full JSON snapshot; `/api/backup/restore` atomically replaces all data in one
  transaction (rolls back on any error) and resets autoincrement sequences. Admin
  Backup page with download + upload/confirm. (Verified by a full round-trip.)
- ⬜ Saved/custom report builder

## 7. Security & administration
- 🟨 Granular permissions — ADMIN can choose which back-office pages a MANAGER may
  open (`Setting.managerPages`); enforced in the sidebar nav + a route gate in
  BackLayout (empty = full access; dashboard always allowed). UI-level access control;
  admin-only data routes (users/branches/audit/backup) remain hard-gated server-side.
  Full per-action backend permission matrix still pending.
- ✅ Audit log of user actions — `AuditLog` model + app-level `auditLogger`
  middleware that records every mutating /api call (actor snapshot, method, path,
  action label, status, IP) after the response finishes; no request bodies stored.
  ADMIN-only viewer page (`/back/audit`) with search / date-range / method filters
  and export
- ✅ Per-user PIN / quick cashier switch on the POS — `User.pinHash`; admin sets/clears
  a 4–8 digit PIN on the Users page; the POS *More* menu has a PIN-pad "สลับผู้ใช้" that
  re-authenticates via `POST /api/auth/pin` and reloads the new user's shift
- ✅ Password management — self-service **change password** (`/api/auth/change-password`,
  verifies current; available to every role from the back-office user menu and the POS
  More menu) + admin **reset password** per user on the Users page (PUT). (True
  forgot-password email flow still pending — no mail infra.)
- ⬜ Online license re-validation + grace handling (currently activate/demo only)

## 8. Platform / offline / PWA
- 🟨 Offline POS — the customer display is an installable PWA, but the POS itself
  doesn't queue sales offline; needs local persistence + sync
- ⬜ Production deploy story (Docker image for server + built web, reverse proxy, HTTPS)
- 🟨 Automated tests + CI — Vitest in `server` (34 unit tests): PromptPay CRC + EMVCo payload,
  ESC/POS code-page + drawer bytes, **split-payment tender** (`lib/tender.ts`), **loyalty
  redeem/earn** (`lib/loyaltyCalc.ts`), **returns refund proration** (`lib/refundCalc.ts`),
  and **quotation/layaway bill totals** (`lib/billing.ts` `buildBill` — also dedups the two
  identical `computeTotals`). The money-critical calcs are pure, tested functions.
  `npm --prefix server test`. GitHub Actions
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): install → prisma generate → test → typecheck-build server +
  web. (Integration/e2e still to expand.)

## 9. Smaller polish / known stubs
- ⬜ Sidebar "เปลี่ยนสาขา" — currently a "coming soon" toast (see §1)
- ⬜ Code-split warning long-term: keep heavy libs lazy as features grow
- ⬜ i18n toggle (UI is Thai-only; English option)
- ⬜ Bundle `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` into .gitignore (build cache currently tracked)
